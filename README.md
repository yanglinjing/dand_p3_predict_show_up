# Analysis of No-Show Appointments (original source on Kaggle)

## Original Data
The original dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

+	'ScheduledDay' tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
+	'Neighborhood 'indicates the location of the hospital.
+ 'Scholarship' indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in _Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família_.
+	The 'No-show' column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

## Purpose
What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

## Analysis
Multiple logistic regression and Confusion Matrix were used in this project to predict whether or not a patient will show up.
